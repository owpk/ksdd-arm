Calling receive will not return a message for a connection that is stopped.

EXPLANATION:
The JMS specification says that calling the receive() method must not return a message if the connection is stopped. Calling receiveNoWait or receive with a timeout will return null when the timeout expires. Calling receive with no timeout will not return until the connection is started or closed or the application terminates.

ACTION:
Start the connection by calling javax.jms.Connection.start().
